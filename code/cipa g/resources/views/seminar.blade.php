                <h4><strong>CIPA Presence At International Cleft Conference – Mahabalipuram 11.02.2017</strong></h4>
                <p class="pad_bot1" style="" align="justify"><h5>The conference in Mahabalipuram was so enthralling that putting the rich experiences gained, in a few words, is unjustifiable. To start with, there was an elite panel of world renowned Doctors, as well as so many Organisations working on the noble cause of cleft treatment across the globe.</p>

                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">The conference was thought provoking. I could not forget one particular debate on the topic of whether the cleft treatment should be done at sponsored institutions or at some specialised institutions. The arguments / counter arguments of Doctor Sadhu and the Doctor from abroad were engrossing. Both the Doctors represented the pros / cons of the treatments at the sponsored or specialised institutions. The other speeches / interactive sessions from various Doctors were precise to the point.</p> 

                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">After the technical sessions, the big moment came. Col. Amik and I were asked to share the dais along with Ms. Stephanie Williamson (Director Of Operation, Cleft Palate Foundation, USA) along with NGO’s from Philippines to address the huge audience. Just to add to the pressure, two halls were combined to increase the audience and Dr. Puneet was not allowed to speak, as it was a parental perspective session. Dr. Karoon also was not there, as he had to skip the presentation due to prior commitments.</p>

                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">It was a big responsibility and a great honour to represent India through CIPA on this mega podium for both Col. Amik and me. We started the presentation and after a few jitters, the flow was maintained. Col. Amik was as usual so supportive and controlled situations very well. The presentation was appreciated by the audience and the time allocated to us also got extended.</p>

                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">After the presentation, there was an interactive Q & A session. We supported each other on question being put to us. There were many queries and to be honest, we were not having perfect answers to a few of them. The overall response of audience was overwhelming and encouraging. The interaction with NGO from Philippines was so humble. </p>

                 <p class="pad_bot1" style="">After our presentation, we were congratulated by all and the Regional Director of Smile Train showed keen interest in CIPA to take it further. We also interacted with many Doctors (e.g. Doctor Kele), who showed keen interest to expand CIPA in their regions. </p>

<p>Presently, CIPA has its registered office at Kalkaji, New Delhi, India. Meetings of patrons are held regularly 
at this office and also in the office of our Chief Patron, Dr. Karoon Agrawal who is the Director-Professor of Department
 Burns, Plastic & Maxillofacial Surgery, Safdarjung Hospital & VMMC, New Delhi. Office of the State Chapter of Delhi is 
 housed with CIPA head office at Kalkaji, New Delhi. Similar, State chapters for all states of India will be established
  in various State in due course of time. However, the entire operations will be limited to India only. Once, the
   procedures are settled and systems get in place after a few years, the jurisdiction of CIPA work will spread to
    other
 parts of the world so that a larger community may benefit from this much needed initiative by the cleft community.
 <h2><strong>K</strong><span>ey Functions:</span></h2>
The focus of CIPA is to psychologically counsel parents and the children in need of effective cleft management assistance.
 CIPA core values include compassion, sympathy, being helpful, motivation, encouragement etc. These are some of the qualities CIPA 
 members have that will assist new parents to overcome the anxiety and fears which they are likely to have. Moreover, sharing of cleft
  journey by CIPA community with the new parents is certainly going to ease their journey. </p>

                <p class="pad_bot1" style="" align="justify"><h5>When I found out I was a Cleft lip and palate patient, I was quite disheartened, shattered actually. But now that I’ve come a long way, I speak of it as a <u>badge of honour.</u> It is quite amazing to see people react in awe when I tell them of my history considering what I have achieved till now. I am not a child prodigy, or I do not have my own start-up giving out millions, but I am a person who’s confident enough to say that I’ve made it out of my teenage years with success.</p> 
                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">Adolescence was quite hard, compared to childhood because at a young age, even if incidents happened, I didn’t realise the reason behind It or its’ meaning. It was in the starting of the adolescence when the environment around me started to change and I realised the sense behind all the comments, ‘jokes’ and ‘preferential’ treatment. Being joked about was not, and is not fun/okay for a person who would be insecure about the way the world looked at them. It used to hurt a lot when friends, and even relatives used to pass comments on the way your face looked. I used to question why I’m different and couldn’t be normal every time I visited the dentist or when I was in an operation theatre. But slowly I started to realise that other humans didn’t matter. Only your family and good friends mattered, which I realised, but later as I grew up. Having a strong support from them and brilliant doctors not only changed the way I looked, but the way I think. </p> 
                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">Today, I feel proud to let anyone know that I invest my time in the right things and I am appreciated about the work I do rather than how I look. I have led IIT Delhi’s sports board as its’ General Secretary, being its student. I Captained the IIT Delhi football team and wear the IITD badge every time I represent my college at the Inter IIT Sports Meet in December. My relatives look up to and praise me because of the hard work I put in. My friends, my good friends, spend time with me because of the person I am. My familfy is proud of me because of the man I’ve become despite the hardships I came from. But to be honest, I am proud to have been a Cleft patient, as it gave me the strength to take on the world in full stride. Because I learnt to face adversities of life at a very young age. And that is why I like to call it a badge of honour.</p> 
                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">To any person, child or adult, facing cleft lip and palate, I’d like to tell you despite what you may think of how wrong this world is, how cruel it is towards you, always remember that what happened in the past will remain in the past. It is the future and more importantly the present which is in your control, which can be shaped into a positive outlook and successful life by the forces of your hard work, confidence and positivity. You’re not just an ordinary human, you’re extra-ordinary in the most amazing way ever!</p>
                <p class="pad_bot1" style="">To any parent or friend reading this, always keep supporting your child/friend. Emotionally, mentally, physically, in any way possible. Show them the right path and guide them, while constantly believing in them that they can do great in life based on their own risks and judgements too. Since I do not have much experience on this front, I’d strongly suggest you to contact my parents and my sister since they did an amazing job and I’m proud and thankful to them for always believing in me! </p>

      <button class="accordion" style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"><span><span><b>What is cleft lip and palate?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
            <p >A cleft is a split or gap in a structure.  A split upper lip is called a Cleft Lip, while the term Cleft Palate is used when the gap involves the roof of the mouth.  The deformity has variable degree of severity.  In its mildest form, there is only a slight notching of the upper lip.  The most severe form involves a cleft of the lip, the palate as well as the intervening alveolus (the bony ridge from which the teeth erupt).  This is known as a Complete Cleft Lip and Palate.  The deformity may affect only one side (a Unilateral Cleft), or both sides may be involved (a Bilateral Cleft).</p>

            <p>
            Whatever the deformity, surgical procedures are available to repair the gap.  This must be undertaken by a trained Plastic Surgeon.  He will work closely with an Orthodontist (Specialist Dentist) and speech language pathologist.  If your child has only a Cleft Lip, one operation will suffice to correct it.  He or she will look and speak normally and the scar will scarcely be visible in later years.  Similarly when only cleft palate is present, single operation will suffice to close the defect in the roof of the mouth.
               </p>

            <p>If your child has Cleft Lip and Palate, two operations will be needed during infancy before the gap is completely closed.  You must expect that with more severe deformity, your child may speak differently from normal children and will therefore require speech therapy.  In addition, regular visits to the Orthodontist will be necessary.</p>

            <p>If the child reports after 2 years of age, then many surgeons perform all the surgeries in one stage. However, most of the surgeons still prefer to repair lip and palate separately in two different operations.</p>

            <button class="accordion" style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"><span><span><b>How often does it occur?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
            <p >In India, approximately 1 in every 700 babies is born with a Cleft deformity.  This means that there are more than 20 lac patients of clefts in our country, which are being managed by around 2000 cleft surgeons. Every year 30,000 to 35,000 children with cleft lip or cleft palate or cleft lip and palate are added to our Indian society.</p>

            <p>
            Cleft lip occurs more often in boys and cleft palate is encountered more often in girls. This speaks of the magnitude of problem existing in our country. 
               </p>

       <button class="accordion" style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"><span><span><b>What causes a cleft lip and cleft palate?  “Is it my fault?”</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
      
            <p>In fact we do not know the answer to this question fully. During early pregnancy, the different parts of the head and face first develop separately and later fuse with each other.  Defective fusion of these parts can result in a cleft deformity.  The exact cause of clefts is not clear, but we know that both genetic and environmental factors play their roles.  Some situations that could result in a cleft deformity are: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>1. A woman who has had rubella infection (German Measles) during early pregnancy.</li>
            <li>2. The use of certain drugs by a woman during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>3. Chromosomal disorders such as Mongolism (Down’s Syndrome)</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>In most cases, there is no identifiable cause i.e. the occurrence of the deformity is sporadic.  Therefore, in the vast majority of cases, the birth of a baby with a cleft deformity is no one’s fault.<b>  It is not due to something you did. So you should not have any feeling of guilt.</b></p>
            <p>Cleft lip and cleft palate may be more likely to occur in pregnant women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol and take certain medications. The main environmental factors which have been reported as possibly increasing the risk of orofacial clefts are tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, solvents and agricultural chemicals. Certain types of anti-epileptic drugs have also been reported to increase the risk. </p>
            <p>Many people believe that cutting a vegetable or holding sharp objects during pregnancy, watching solar eclipse, evil act, karma, incarnation, witchcraft, God’s punishment, eating rabbit meat, adultery by mother, Djinn (evil spirits), black magic or walking outdoor on Amavasya may cause cleft in the new born. On the other hand many community consider it as God’s gift. However, these are only beliefs and there is no scientific basis to any one of them. Scientifically we consider these causes as only myth. Hence please do not them seriously. </p>
            <p><img src="images/cap2.jpg" border="0" alt="" height="300px" width="300px" style="  border-radius: 8px;" /></p></div>


     <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> <span><span><b>Will my next baby have a cleft?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>It is unlikely.  There is dependable evidence of its occurrence in family. The risk of occurrence of cleft lip and palate is more in families where already the parents or grand parents or other siblings have cleft. So if there is history of cleft in two or more family members, the chances of cleft in next child is high. </p>

            <p>Depending on the situation, the following probabilities have been worked out:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. IF BOTH PARENTS ARE NORMAL AND 1 CHILD HAS A CLEFT; the chance of the second child having a cleft is 1 in 20.</li>
<li>2. IF BOTH PARENTS ARE NORMAL AND BOTH 1ST AND 2ND CHILDREN HAVE CLEFTS, The chance of the next child having a cleft is 1 in 4.</li>
<li>3. IF 1 PARENT HAS A CLEFT, The chance of the first child having a cleft is 1 in 20.</li>
<li>4. IF 1 PARENT HAS A CLEFT AND 1 CHILD HAS A CLEFT, The chance of the next child having a cleft is 1 in 4.</li>
<li>5. IF BOTH THE PARENTS HAVE CLEFTS, The chance of the first child having a cleft is 1 in 4.</li></ul>
<br><p>If you have any doubts, your Surgeon will refer you to the Geneticist who will provide you with genetic counselling.</p>

 <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> <span><span><b>How Are Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate Diagnosed?</b></span></span></span></button>
<div class="panel"  style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Now the orofacial clefts are quite commonly diagnosed during pregnancy, usually by a routine ultrasound. New 3D ultrasounds give very clear picture of the baby’s face and one can see the cleft lip in 18 week baby in uterus. In routine, orofacial clefts are diagnosed after the baby is born. However, sometimes minor clefts (e.g., submucous cleft palate and bifid uvula) might not be diagnosed until later in life.</p>

<p>If the clefting has not been detected in an ultrasound prior to the baby's birth, a physical examination of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms the presence of cleft lip or cleft palate after a child's birth. Sometimes diagnostic testing may be conducted to determine or rule out the presence of other abnormalities.</p>

       <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;">  <span><span><b>What Problems Are Associated With Cleft Lip and/or Palate?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
           <p>There are few problems associated with cleft lip and palate. There are some related to cleft lip and some special problems are associated with cleft palate.</p>

<p>The problems with cleft lip are mainly cosmetic problem. It does not look good in centre of the face and attracts public attention. But there is not much functional problem with cleft lip. The teeth may be deformed in the region of the cleft lip but all other functions remain normal.</p>

<p>Cleft palate is more notorious and cause large number of functional problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    1.  Feeding problem
  </li>
  <li>
    2.  Nutritional deficiency because of difficulty in feeding
  </li>
  <li>
    3.  General growth may be affected because of deficient nutrition.
  </li>
  <li>
    4.  Child swallows more air and so causes vomiting after feeding.
  </li>
  <li>
    5.  Speech may be abnormal
  </li>
  <li>
    6.  Teeth may be deformed
  </li>
  <li>
    7.  Midface (Maxilla) may not develop adequately causing depressed central face.
  </li>
  <li>
    8.  Middle ear infection and discharging ear
  </li>
  <li>
    9.  Hearing may be affected
  </li>
  <li>
    10. Recurrent respiratory infection may occur.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Some of the important problems are given in detail in following questions.</p>

             <button class="accordion"  style=" color:#575652; font-size: 17px;">  <span><span><b>Will I have problems feeding my baby?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
     
   
            <p>Babies with clefts have trouble with feeding because the normal anatomy of the oral cavity is disrupted. Normally, a baby pulls the nipple into the mouth and makes a seal with the lips around the nipple. When a baby sucks and swallows, their palate rises up and closes off the mouth from the nose. This creates suction so that the breast or bottle nipple is held in the mouth and the milk is drawn out. When a cleft lip is present, it may be difficult for the baby to make a good seal around the nipple. When a cleft palate is present, the mouth cannot be closed off from the nose and little or no suction can be created.</p>

<p>Your baby may suck more slowly and feeding time may be longer.  Do not be alarmed if some of the feeds flow out through the nose, causing spluttering or coughing.  This is due to the cleft in the palate.  You must be gentle and patient.  Do not rush a feed or choking may result.  Prolonged feeding may exhaust your child, so use smaller feeds but at more frequent intervals.</p>

 <button class="accordion"  style=" color:#575652; font-size: 17px;">
   <span><span><b>How should I feed my baby?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p><b>Cleft lip:</b> For breastfeeding babies, the soft breast tissue often will fill the opening in the lip and/or gum line well, sealing off the mouth and allowing the baby to create adequate suction. Sometimes it is helpful for the mother to hold a finger across the cleft during feeding. Swallowing noises and a bowel movement after feeding are signs that breast-feeding is going well. If the baby is "noisy" with feeding, making clicking or kissing noises, suction may not be adequate.</p><p>
          Mothers who choose to bottle-feed their babies with cleft lip should try using nipples with a wider base, or their infants may need special bottles or nipples. When starting a feeding, hold the baby in a slightly upright position. Touch the baby's lower lip with the nipple. When the baby latches on, direct the nipple slightly downwards. Try to keep the nipple in the center of the baby's mouth. Do not let it slip up into the cleft.
          </p>

<p><b>Cleft Palate-</b> with or without Cleft Lip:  Babies with cleft palate usually need special bottles and techniques to feed adequately. It's rarely possible to breastfeed or use a regular bottle because the baby's nose and mouth are not separated and they cannot create suction to get the milk out of the breast or bottle. A baby who is put to the breast may look like they are sucking well, but they are using up energy and getting little or no milk. We encourage mothers who planned to breastfeed to express their milk and feed it to their infants using a special bottle or spoon. While breast milk is considered the most ideal food for all babies, there are added benefits for babies with cleft palate, such as a lower incidence of middle ear infection. </p>

<p>In India, we recommend spoon-feeding rather than bottle-feeding before the cleft is repaired. In some parts of the country, a cup with long nozzle known as “Paaladai” is used effectively. A baby who is not used to spoon-feeding may refuse such feeds during the postoperative period.  This may irritate the baby and cause excessive crying. Feeding can be done using a simple cup and spoon, paaladai, a feeding cup or a milk bottle with a spoon attachment.  Hold your baby lying well back in your arms and gently tip the milk from the spoon to the back of the tongue.  Spoon-feeding is slower but should be used at least until the Cleft Lip or Palate has been repaired.  Our nurses will teach you how to feed your baby correctly.</p>

   <span><span><b>How to Feed with Breast Milk?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Mothers should choose to express breast milk using a pump or the hand to get milk out of the breast. Breast pumps are available in market. Mothers should pump at least six times in 24 hours, including at least once during the night. After several weeks of this intensive pumping, most mothers can provide enough milk for their babies.</p>
            <p>
              Many centres are promoting direct breast feeding to cleft palate children. With special training by nurses, the mothers can feed the baby directly from breast. The breast nipple is put inside the mouth and the milk is expressed with fingers by mother. This encourages the mother to take care of baby and develops mother-child bonding.

   <span><span><b>Which Bottles to be used in cleft palate children?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;"> 
            <p>There are many types of special bottles available on net and market - the Mead-Johnson Cleft Palate Nurser, the Haberman Feeder and the Pigeon Nipple are popular ones:</p>

              <img src="images/bottles.jpg" border="0" alt="" height="300px" width="600px" style="  border-radius: 8px;" />
            </p>
            <p>All of these bottles and nipples should be regularly washed with hot water, dried and then use. They should not be boiled directly in boiling water. They will be damaged with high heat.</p>

    <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;">
   <span><span><b>How Much and how often the baby should be fed?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>New born babies take small quantity of milk initially but their requirement increases very quickly. These babies need 100 to 120 ml of milk for each kg of body weight in whole day. 2.5 kg baby requires approximately 300 ml of complete milk in whole day. One should not mix water in the milk which will dilute the nutrient in the milk and child’s nutrition will suffer.</p> 
            <p>
              These children should be given frequent and small quantity of milk in one session. For satisfactory growth of the baby adequate feed is essential.  In cleft lip and palate children it is more important as risk of anaesthesia increases in anaemic and underweight children. Hence child’s nutrition needs to be watched every month. Best way to monitor the growth is by checking the weight and haemoglobin of the child every month.

<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>When the child is 3 months or more supplementary liquid feed in the form of daal, soup, curd etc. should be started.  And little later soft feed like mashed potato, custard, mashed khichadi, halwa, vegetable pulps etc. may be started.  Semisolids may be better accepted in cleft palate children due to less risk of nasal regurgitation.</p><p><img src="images/cap8.jpg" border="0" alt="" height="300px" width="300px" style="  border-radius: 8px;" /></p> </div>

            <p>Surgery to repair a cleft lip is done within 3 to 6 months of life.  Your baby should have a good body weight corresponding to its age.  If the Plastic Surgeon suggests postponing the lip operation, it may be to improve the general condition of the baby to reduce the possibility of complications during surgery. Sometimes the anaesthetist must be wanting better health for introducing general anaesthesia for the operation.   Cleft lip surgery is not an emergency and you should not worry, if the surgery is judiciously delayed for some reason or the other.  You are most welcome to discuss the timing and its consequences with the treating plastic surgeon.</p>

However in few centres the cleft palate surgery is done first if the parents seek plastic surgery consultation at a later age because of some or other reason. Cleft palate surgery is scheduled between 6 to 12 months of age.  Timely operation helps minimize abnormal speech habits that a child can develop when learning to speak with cleft palate. Hence cleft palate repair must be done well on time.</p>
<p><ul><li>
1.  Speech assessment is done after 3 years</li><li>
2.  Phase I orthodontics around 7 years of age during mixed dentition.</li><li>
3.  Surgical bone graft in area of cleft in the alveolus (Aleveolar Bone grafting) at 9-11 years of age.</li><li>
4.  Speech assessment and therapy at regular intervals and management of Velopharyngeal incompetence at an appropriate time.</li><li>
5.  Phase II orthodontics – in permanent dentition: full therapy to align dentition.</li><li>
6.  Orthognathic surgery after completion of growth for correction of occlusion.</li><li>
7.  Final touch up in adulthood- Correction of scar, any deformity in lip, Nose correction and nasal septal correction if deviated. </li><li>
8. Ear needs to be checked from early childhood or whenever child has some complains.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>In some centres baby’s hands and arms are restrained with elbow splints so that the baby cannot touch or rub the operated area. The arm restraint, if used, won’t hurt your baby but most babies make fuss at not being able to move their arms freely.  To make the baby adjust to these splints they are tied around the arm soon after admission into the hospital.</p>
            <p>
              Once your baby recovers from anaesthesia, he will sleep off for 1 – 2 hours.  Feeds are started slowly when he/she wakes up.  The baby has to be fed slowly in a sitting position to minimise discomfort.  A little water must be given at the end of each food to clear the baby’s mouth. Usually the baby is fed only on liquid diet for a period of 2 - 3 weeks after surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the surgery you should not carry the baby over the shoulder to make him sleep or the baby may hit the operated area (especially after the lip repair) against your shoulder resulting in wound breakdown, which will lead to an unsatisfactory result.  Also you should guard the baby so that he or she doesn’t rub his or her face against the pillow or cot.  Remember that a little carelessness in guarding the child postoperatively can lead to injury and a permanent bad scar over the lip.  You should keep all hard and semi hard objects away from the baby’s mouth including straws, spoon, pacifiers and nipples.  While feeding with a spoon, it shouldn’t go in the child’s mouth.  The child should be fed with the side of the spoon.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Feeding at home is same as instructed during the hospital stay.  The child has to be given only liquid diet for 3 weeks until healing is complete.  The baby should not have potato chips, cookies or other hard foods.</p>
            <p>
              You should bring the baby for follow-up whenever called which is usually 2-3 weeks after the surgery.  You can seek the surgeon’s opinion regarding starting of semisolid or solid food.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some children get earaches after cleft palate surgery due to swelling of the throat tissues.  If this happens, you may need to consult the an ENT specialist. </p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Some children with Cleft Palate develop speech difficulties.  But timely surgery and early attention by a Speech Therapist will usually overcome these problems, so that they will be able to speak normally by the time they go to school.  Occasionally a child may require further surgery to improve his or her speech.  Parental attention is very important in this respect.</p>
            <p>
             <b> Your child’s speech development</b><br>
Speech problems occur because of incorrect speech pattern learned before the palate is operated or the repaired soft palate is not able to close off the nose, so the air and sound escapes into the nose during speech.  In some children there are certain inbuilt defects in speech mechanism, which are difficult to explain.
  
            </p>
            <p>
             <b>Role of speech Therapist (Pathologist)</b><br>
  Speech Therapist is a very important member of the team.  Speech therapists are trained to prevent as well as to correct speech problems. They can teach children with clefts to develop clear speech and show parents how to do speech therapy with their children at home.  Parents play a great role in speech learning of these babies.

      <span><span><b>Why my child is getting frequent running nose?</b></span></span></button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p> Children with cleft palate may have frequent running nose.  This is because the food material enters inside the nasal cavity during feed.  This irritates the nasal cavity and causes repeated infection.  Whenever child suffers from respiratory infection it is better to consult a paediatrician.  But one need not worry.  This problem is not expected in children with isolated cleft lip. This problem is resolved after repair of the cleft palate.</p>

      <span><span><b>Will the child’s hearing be affected?</b></span></span></button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Children with cleft palate have more ear problems than other children. The hearing has to be checked regularly.  The ENT specialist should perform regular ear check-up.  In some centres ear is checked before first operation.  If required a small tube (Grommet) is inserted to avoid harm to the eardrum in future. The hearing loss may cause language learning problem because children must hear clearly in order to learn words and sentences.  Poor hearing may lead to incorrect speech because the child can’t copy the sounds accurately.</p>

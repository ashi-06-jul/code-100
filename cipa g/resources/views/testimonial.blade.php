                With courage in her heart and might in her pocket,<br>
                With zeal in her eyes and stardust in her locket,<br>
                She had her destination and knew how to knock it,<br>
                Every part of her had wanted to crack it.<br>
                It was hard, or impossible, said some,<br>
                She wanted it, and wanted it bad, listened to none.<br>
                Picking her bags, she started to run,<br>
                The world called it madness, she called it fun.<br>
                "Stop!" shouted the lads, "Wait!" pleaded her lungs,<br>
                But the bell at her heart had not yet rung,<br>
                Crawling and falling, to the peak, she plunged,<br>
                Grasping the rays of the sun,<br>
                She whispered, "I said I could do it and see it's done!"<br><br>

                    She has melody flowing through her veins<br>
                    She has defeated the fearful pains<br>
                    She is the beautiful sunrise, the daring sunset<br>
                    Her persona is a powerful threat<br>

                    She is tangled, she is free<br>

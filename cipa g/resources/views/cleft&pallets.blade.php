<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
            <p >Approximately 1 out of every 600 babies are born with a cleft (opening) in the upper lip or palate (roof of the mouth). Normally, as a baby is developing, the tissues that form the upper lip and palate grow together and eventually fuse. For babies with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate, this fusion did not occur properly. Clefts of the upper lip and/or palate may be unilateral (only one side of the mouth affected) or bilateral (both sides affected). A cleft palate can involve the hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), and/or the soft palate (the soft back portion of the roof of the mouth).  In addition, a baby may have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both. </p>
<p>Compared with girls, twice as many boys have a cleft lip, both with and without a cleft palate. </p>
<p>However, compared with boys, twice as many girls have cleft palate without a cleft lip.</p>
<p>India, undoubtedly, has a very large cleft population, which at over a million is well above the entire population of some countries! Every passing year adds another 32,000- 35,000 to the figure.</p><p><img src="images/cleft-lip.gif" border="0" alt="" height="300px" width="300px" style="  border-radius: 8px;" /></p>  </div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
      <p></p>
            <p>In most cases, the cause of cleft lip and cleft palate is unknown. Most scientists believe clefts are due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There appears to be a greater chance of clefting in a newborn if a sibling, parent, or relative has had the problem. In other situations, cleft lip and cleft palate may be part of another medical condition.<br />Researchers believe that most cases of cleft lip and cleft palate are caused by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. In many babies, a definite cause isn't discovered. </p>
<ul>
<li>Genes inherited from the parents. Either the mother or the father can pass on genes that cause clefting, either as an isolated defect or as part of a syndrome that includes clefting as one of its signs. In some cases, babies inherit a gene that makes them more likely to develop a cleft, and then an environmental trigger actually causes the cleft to occur. Orofacial clefts present as part of the phenotype in over 600 specific genetic syndromes, more commonly in association with isolated CP. The proportion of CL/P associated with specific syndromes has been reported as between five and seven per cent. There exists a male preponderance in CL/P predominance of left-sided clefting. In an attempt to determine which genes are involved, genetic linkage studies have been conducted suggesting a variety of loci, including regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 14, 17, and 19.and a meta-analysis of whole genome linkage studies suggests putative loci at 2q32–q35 and 9q21–q33.A variety of genetic polymorphisms have been investigated in population based association studies. Genes responsible for growth factors (e.g. TGFα, TGFβ3), transcription factors (e.g. MSX1, IRF6, TBX22), or factors which influence xenobiotic metabolism (e.g. CYP1A1, GSTM1, NAT2), nutrient metabolism (e.g. MTHFR, RARA) or immune response (e.g. PVRL1, IRF6) have been implicated. An interesting recent finding is that the gene, IRF6, the gene implicated in Van der Woude syndrome (VDWS) has been shown to play a strong role in the isolated form of clefting,</li>
<li>Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy. Cleft lip and cleft palate may be more likely to occur in pregnant women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol and take certain medications. The main environmental factors which have been reported as possibly increasing the risk of orofacial clefts are tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, solvents and agricultural chemicals. Certain types of anti-epileptic drugs have also been reported to increase the risk. It is, however, an established fact that the magnitude of the risk of recurrence of orofacial clefts to siblings.and the increase in risk after two or more affected siblings is greater than that predicted by the familial aggregation of environmental risk factors.</li>

     <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> <span><span><b>Risk factors</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Several factors may increase the likelihood of a baby developing a cleft lip and cleft palate, including: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family history.</strong> Parents with a family history of cleft lip or cleft palate face a higher risk of having a baby with a cleft.</li>
<li><strong>Race.</strong> Cleft lip and palate are most common in American Indian and Asian children. Black children are least likely to have a cleft.</li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong>. Males are twice as likely to have a cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Cleft palate without cleft lip is more common in females.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy.</strong> Babies born to women who smoked or drank alcohol or poor nutrition during pregnancy are more likely to develop cleft lip and cleft palate. Cleft lip and cleft palate may also occur as a result of exposure to viruses or chemicals while the fetus is developing in the womb.</li>
<li><strong>Being obese during pregnancy.</strong> There is some evidence that babies born to obese women may have increased risk of cleft lip and palate. </li>
<li><strong>Diabetes</strong> ―Women with diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy have been shown to be an increased risk of having a child with a cleft lip with or without cleft palate</li>
<li><strong>Medication</strong> a mother may have taken during her pregnancy: anti-seizure/anticonvulsant drugs, acne drugs containing Accutane, and methotrexate.</li>
</ul></div>
 <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> <span><span><b>How Are Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate Diagnosed?</b></span></span></span></button>
<div class="panel"  style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Orofacial clefts sometimes can be diagnosed during pregnancy, usually by a routine ultrasound. Most often, orofacial clefts are diagnosed after the baby is born. However, sometimes minor clefts (e.g., submucous cleft palate and bifid uvula) might not be diagnosed until later in life.</p>
<p>If the clefting has not been detected in an ultrasound prior to the baby's birth, a physical examination of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms the presence of cleft lip or cleft palate after a child's birth. Sometimes diagnostic testing may be conducted to determine or rule out the presence of other abnormalities.</p>
<p><img src="images/Cleft-Palate-Diagnosed.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>  </div>  
       <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;">  <span><span><b>What Problems Are Associated With Cleft Lip and/or Palate?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
           <p>Eating problems. With a separation or opening in the palate, food and liquids can pass from the mouth back through the nose. Feeding In babies, the palate is important in generating suction when feeding. Babies with an unrepaired cleft palate will typically have difficulties creating enough suction to get sufficient milk from the breast or teat. In addition, they may also have difficulty compressing a nipple or teat if there is not enough gum or palate to compress against. This can make feeding a long and tiring process, and the baby may not get enough milk for adequate growth. Fortunately, specially designed baby bottles and nipples that help keep fluids flowing downward toward the stomach are available. Sometimes Children with a cleft palate may need to wear a man-made palate to help them eat properly and ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition until surgical treatment is provided. Done by a dentist or orthodontist  even days after birth.</p>
<p>Ear infections/hearing loss. Children with cleft palate are at increased risk of ear infections since they are more prone to fluid build-up in the middle ear. If left untreated, ear infections can cause hearing loss.  Every baby with a cleft palate needs to have their hearing monitored closely by an audiologist – a hearing assessment should generally be arranged for when the baby is around 4 weeks old, and repeated again at around 12 weeks of age. After the second hearing test, a review appointment with an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon is required. At this time a decision will be made regarding the need for small tubes (grommets) to be inserted into the eardrums. This can usually be done at the same time as the palate is repaired. Tubes usually stay in the eardrums for around 6–9 months. Some children will need more tubes if hearing problems continue. Annual hearing tests are recommended during early childhood for children with a history of cleft palate.</p>
<p>Speech problems. Children with cleft lip or cleft palate may also have trouble speaking. These children's voices don't carry well, the voice may take on a nasal sound, and the speech may be difficult to understand. The palate is very important in speech. In the closed position the palate usually shuts off tightly against the back and sides of the throat to make a seal which stops air from entering the nose. This is very important for a large number of consonants (p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, sh, ch) and for the tone of speech. If the palate does not do its job, air escapes into the nose and may prevent development of consonants as well as cause an excessively nasal sounding voice. Some children also develop a range of sounds not usually heard in their native language. This makes them difficult to understand and is frustrating to the child. Speech therapy is usually helpful in eliminating these sounds and developing the sounds found in the child’s native languageNot all children have these problems and surgery may fix these problems entirely for some. For others, a special doctor, called speech pathologist, will work with the child to resolve speech difficulties.</p>
<p>Dental Problems. Children with clefts are more prone to a larger than average number of cavities and often have missing, extra, malformed, or displaced teeth requiring dental and orthodontic treatments. In addition, children with cleft palate often have an alveolar ridge defect. The alveolus is the bony upper gum that contains teeth. A defect in the alveolus can (1) displace, tip, or rotate permanent teeth, (2) prevent permanent teeth from appearing, and (3) prevent the alveolar ridge from forming. These problems can usually be repaired through oral surgery.</p><p><img src="images/cleftlip.gif" border="0" alt="" /></p></div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
     
   
            <p>Members of a cleft lip and palate team typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plastic surgeon to evaluate and perform necessary surgeries on the lip and/or palate</li>
<li>An otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat doctor) to evaluate hearing problems and consider treatment options for hearing problems</li>
<li>An oral surgeon to reposition segments of the upper jaw when needed, to improve function and appearance and to repair the cleft of the gum</li>
<li>An orthodontist to straighten and reposition teeth</li>
<li>A dentist to perform routine dental care</li>
<li>A prosthodontist to make artificial teeth and dental appliances to improve the appearance and to meet functional requirements for eating and speaking</li>
<li>A speech pathologist to assess speech and feeding problems</li>
<li>A speech therapist to work with the child to improve speech</li>
<li>An audiologist (a specialist in communication disorders stemming from a hearing impairment); to assess and monitor hearing</li>
<li>A nurse coordinator to provide ongoing supervision of the child's health</li>
<li>A social worker/psychologist to support the family and assess any adjustment problems</li>
<li>A geneticist to help parents and adult patients understand the chances of having more children with these conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The health care team works together to develop a plan of care to meet the individual needs of each patient. Some teams have other members like a medical photographer, pediatrician etc. Treatment usually begins in infancy and often continues through early adulthood. In india cleft teams are there in only selected hospitals.

   <span><span><b>What’s the Treatment for Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Suggested Protocol for Treating Clefts </p>
<ol>
<li>Optional pre-surgical orthodontics – in infancy</li>
<li>Surgical repair of lip and palate</li>
<li>Phase I orthodontics - in mixed dentition: differential expansion &amp; alignment </li>
<li>Surgical bone graft in area of cleft</li>
<li>Phase II orthodontics – in permanent dentition: full mechanotherapy to align dentition</li>
<li>Orthognathic surgery (phase III orthodontics): integrated with growth completion</li>
<li>Prosthetic &amp; esthetic reconstruction – young adults</li>
</ol>
<p><b>PNAM:</b> Presurgical naso alveolar molding. The nasoalveolar moulding appliance (NAM) consists of an intraoral moulding plate with nasal stents to mould the alveolar ridge and nasal cartilage concurrently. The objective of the presurgical NAM is to reduce the severity of the original cleft deformity and thereby enable the surgeon to achieve better repair of the alveolus, lip and nose. Use of the NAM technique has also eliminated surgical columella reconstruction and the resultant scar tissue in bilateral cleft lip and palate. <br />This technique takes advantage of the malleability of immature nasal cartilage and its ability to maintain a permanent correction of its form. </p>
<p><b>Lip Repair:</b> Within the first 3–4 months after birth, surgery is performed to close the cleft lip. While surgery to repair a cleft lip can be performed soon after birth, often the preferred age is above 10 weeks of age, following the "rule of 10s" coined by surgeons Wilhelmmesen and Musgrave in 1969 (the child is at least 10 weeks of age; weighs at least 10 pounds, and has at least 10g hemoglobin). If the cleft is bilateral and extensive, two surgeries may be required to close the cleft, one side first, and the second side a few weeks later. Cleft lip repair, also called cheiloplasty, reconstructs the normal appearance, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure of the cleft resulting in a scar located in the normal structures of the upper lip </li>
<li>Formation of a cupid’s bow (the curve at the center of the upper lip) </li>
<li>Considerations for adequate distance between the upper lip and nose </li>
</ul>
<p>Cleft Palate Repair: Cleft palate can also be corrected by surgery, usually performed between 6 and 12 months. Approximately 20–25% only require one palatal surgery to achieve a competent velopharyngeal valve capable of producing normal, non-hypernasal speech. However, combinations of surgical methods and repeated surgeries are often necessary as the child grows. Because the palate creates the ﬂoor of the nasal cavity, considerations in repairing a cleft palate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing for normal growth, function and speech development </li>
<li>Relation of the palate to the auditory canal and hearing </li>
</ul>
<b>Development of the teeth and jaw alignment</b>>
<p><b>Alveolar Bone Grafting (Phase 1 Orthodontics):</b> Children with a cleft palate may also need a bone graft when they are about 7-9 years old to fill in the upper gum line so that it can support permanent teeth and stabilize the upper jaw. The reasons for performing a bone graft are to stabilize the maxillary segments, provide bony support for the teeth adjacent to the cleft, give additional support for the alar base and allow for the movement of the cuspid into the lateral incisor position. Typically, this procedure is performed at a stage of transitional dentition, when the canine root has not fully formed; this provides an osseous environment to support tooth eruption into the arch. The orthodontic arch preparation is required in many cases to allow for a successful bone graft.</p>
<p><b>Orthodontic Treatment (Phase 2).</b>> This is done in the permanent dentition to align the arch just like any regular child would undergo at this age.</p>
<p><b>Orthodontic treatment before and after orthognathic (jaw) surgery (Phase 3):</b> Due to the scar of the repaired lip and palate, in about 25-30% of the cleft children the upper jaw growth is retarded. It cannot match the lower jaw growth. In such children jaw surgery will correct the deformity. This is usually done when the growth is complete, in adulthood. This requires an orthodontic treatment before orthognathic surgery and after surgery to fit the teeth into good intercuspation. </p>
<p>Misc: Additional surgeries may be performed to improve the appearance of the lip and nose, close openings between the mouth and nose, help breathing, and stabilize and realign the jaw. Final repairs of the scars left by the initial surgery will probably not be performed until adolescence, when the facial structure is more fully developed.</p> <p><img src="images/Depositphotos.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>   </div>

   <span><span><b>Feeding</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Babies with clefts have trouble with feeding because the normal anatomy of the oral cavity is disrupted. Normally, a baby pulls the nipple into the mouth and makes a seal with the lips around the nipple. When a baby sucks and swallows, their soft palate rises up and closes off the mouth from the nose. This creates suction so that the breast or bottle nipple is held in the mouth and the milk is drawn out. When a cleft lip is present, it may be difficult for the baby to make a good seal around the nipple. When a cleft palate is present, the mouth cannot be closed off from the nose and little or no suction can be created.</p> </div>

   <span><span><b>How to feed a cleft baby?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;"> 
            <p>Infants with cleft lip can usually be fed by breast or regular bottle. Some help from the nurses or infant-feeding specialists may be needed to ensure that the infant can get a tight seal around the nipple.</p>
<p>Cleft lip: For breastfeeding babies, the soft breast tissue often will fill the opening in the lip and/or gum line well, sealing off the mouth and allowing the baby to create adequate suction. Sometimes it is helpful for the mother to hold a finger across the cleft during feeding. Swallowing noises and a bowel movement after feeding are signs that breast-feeding is going well. If the baby is "noisy" with feeding, making clicking or kissing noises, suction may not be adequate.<br />Mothers who choose to bottle-feed their babies with cleft lip should try using nipples with a wider base, or their infants may need specialty bottles or nipples. When starting a feeding, hold the baby in a slightly upright position. Touch the baby's lower lip with the nipple. When the baby latches on, direct the nipple slightly downwards. Try to keep the nipple in the center of the baby's mouth. Do not let it slip up into the cleft.</p>     <div class="clr"></div>

   <span><span><b>Cleft Palate: with or without Cleft Lip</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Babies with cleft palate usually need special bottles and techniques to feed adequately. It's rarely possible to breastfeed or use a regular bottle because the baby's nose and mouth are not separated and they cannot create suction to get the milk out of the breast or bottle. A baby who is put to the breast may look like they are latching on and sucking well, but they are using up energy and getting little or no milk. We encourage mothers who planned to breastfeed to express their milk and feed it to their infants using a special bottle. While breast milk is considered the most ideal food for all babies, there are added benefits for babies with cleft palate, such as a lower incidence of middle ear infection. This situation is often difficult for mothers who were looking forward to breastfeeding their babies. It is common for mothers to feel great sadness at the loss of this experience. It is important to acknowledge this loss and help mothers maintain closeness with their infants.</p>  </div>
             <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;">
   <span><span><b>Bottles?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>There are three types of bottles that we recommend for feeding babies with clefts - the Mead-Johnson Cleft Palate Nurser, the Haberman Feeder and the Pigeon Nipple:</p>
<p><img src="images/bottles.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>All of these bottles and nipples can be hand washed in hot soapy water, rinsed and allowed to thoroughly air dry. Do not boil the bottles or parts, wash them in the dishwasher or put them in a microwave. They may soften and start to leak.</p> </div> 
 <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> 
      <span><span><b>How to Express Breast Milk?</b></span></span></button>
   <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Mothers who choose to express breast milk (using a pump or the hand to get milk out of the breast) for their babies should get a hospital-grade electric breast pump with a double pumping system. Birth hospitals have pumps for mothers to use in the hospital and can assist families with obtaining pumps for home use. Breast pumps can be rented or purchased. Mothers should pump at least eight times in 24 hours at first, including at least once during the night. After several weeks of this intensive pumping, most mothers can provide enough milk for their babies by pumping about six times a day.</p>    </div>
     
     <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> 
      <span><span><b>How Much and how often the baby should feed?</b></span></span></button>
   <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Newborn babies begin taking small amounts, one ounce or less, of milk often, and gradually increase the amount they are able to drink. By 2 weeks of age, a baby needs to drink at least two to two and a half ounces of milk per pound of weight each day. No feeding session should take longer than 30 minutes. If it takes longer, the infant is working too hard and burning calories needed for growth. The measure of success of any feeding plan is adequate weight gain. During the first month of life, a baby will feed eight to twelve times per day, or every two to three hours. A baby this young usually feeds at least twice during the night. At 2 to 4 months old, a baby will feed six to eight times per day, or every three to four hours. </p>
<p>Weight gain: A baby usually loses weight the first week of life. Most times, the loss is 5 to10 % of body weight. This weight is regained with a baby returning to birth weight by 2 weeks old. The amount of weight gain expected for a baby is about five to seven ounces per week. At 4 to 6 months old, the rate of weight gain slows to about three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half ounces per week. Sometimes infants with cleft lip and palate will have difficulties taking enough breast milk or formula to grow. To help these babies grow, formula powder can be added to breast milk or regular formula for added calories, protein and vitamins. This should only be done under the supervision of the medical team and only with an approved recipe.</p></div>

      <span><span><b>What About Starting Solid Foods?</b></span></span></button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Babies with clefts can start solid foods at the same age as other babies, usually between 4 and 6 months of age. Experiment to find the right consistency for solids. It needs to be just right so that the baby can eat without the food coming through the nose. Again, this isn't harmful to the child and sneezing will usually clear the food out of the nose. Most babies learn quickly to get the food down their throats rather than out their noses.</p>
